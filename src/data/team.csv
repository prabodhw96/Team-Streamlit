Diogo Pernes,"I graduated with Electrical and Computer Engineering (5-year Master's degree) and am currently a PhD candidate in Computer Science at University of Porto. My research work is conducted at INESC TEC, Porto, Portugal, under the supervision of Jaime S. Cardoso, Full Professor at the same university. My research area is machine learning, mostly for computer vision applications. The main topics of my research are multi-entity and multi-domain learning and domain adaptation.","My decision to participate in the Pandemic Response Challenge and, in particular, to join the M-montreal-quebec team was motivated by a strong desire to collaborate with and learn from my teammates, as the expertise and background knowledge that each element of our team has are diverse and unique. In addition, the relevance of the proposed problem to the entire world is beyond any question, so I could not miss the opportunity to at least try to contribute to its solution.",,[GitHub](https://github.com/dpernes)&nbsp;[Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=KJMO7ckAAAAJ&hl=pt-PT)&nbsp;[Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/diogo-pernes-44631885/)
Thin Nguyen,"I am a Senior Research Fellow at Applied Artificial Intelligence Institute (A2I2) at Deakin University, Australia. I graduated with a PhD in Computer Science from Curtin University, Australia in the area of machine learning and social media analytics. My research direction is to utilize artificial intelligence methods to discover functional connections between drugs, genes and diseases. I am also a [Kaggle Master](https://www.kaggle.com/jessky), ranked 253th out of 150K+ Kagglers, as of Jan. 2021.","I am excited to join the Pandemic Response Challenge as it is about applying machine learning techniques to solve real-world problems, similar to those offered by DREAM Single Cell Transcriptomics Challenge (winner - first place) & Kaggle competitions. In addition, the solutions would help policy makers making informed decisions in dealing with the pandemic.",,[GitHub](https://github.com/thinng)&nbsp;[Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user=BlTfdtMAAAAJ)&nbsp;[Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thin-nguyen-4364167a/)
Marharyta Aleksandrova,"After completing a master’s degree from the National Technical University of Ukraine “Igor Sikorsky Kyiv Polytechnic Institute”, I started my research path by pursuing a joint doctorate program between France (University of Lorraine) and Ukraine (Igor Sikorsky KPI). Currently, I hold the position of postdoctoral researcher at the University of Luxembourg. During these years, I have been exposed to various applications of data science and worked on several European and national research projects.","I have been studying causal inference and causal learning recently. The aim of this challenge is to build a prescriptive model. Such models ideally should be based on causal relationships. In this way, the challenge offers me an excellent opportunity to apply my newfound knowledge. I always wanted to be involved in the projects with a direct and visible impact.",,[Personal Email](mailto:marharyta.aleksandrova@gmail.com)&nbsp;[Institutional Email](mailto:marharyta.aleksandrova@uni.lu)&nbsp;[Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=rwcqydIAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao)&nbsp;[Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marharyta-aleksandrova-8b567245/)
Prabodh Wankhede,"I am pursuing M.Sc. in Computer Science at Université de Montréal (Prof. M.Sc. at Mila). I am exploring and am open to work on application of machine learning in domains such as ethics, governance, healthcare, finance etc. Being at Mila blessed me with the opportunity to participate in the Pandemic Response Challenge and work with extraordinary people both at Mila and elsewhere in the world. I see this challenge as an attempt to learn from smarter folks and direct my skills towards a highly dynamic real-world scenario.",,,[GitHub](https://github.com/prabodhw96)&nbsp;[Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/prabodhwankhede)
Olexa Bilaniuk,"I am a graduate of the UdeM and Research Software Developer at Mila. My interests are computer architectures, hardware accelerators, systems software and high-performance computing and optimization. Having been involved in a previous project to simulate the spread of COVID-19 and trace it using AI, I was more than willing to lend my skills in software optimization to further machine-learning projects in the fight against the pandemic.",,,
Chen-Yang Su,"I am currently an M.Sc. student in Computer Science at McGill University/Mila. My current interests are in applications of machine learning to healthcare and my hopes are to be able to improve clinical decision making and tackle the current challenges of evidence based medicine. My broad interests include machine learning (deep learning, reinforcement learning), statistical genetics and epidemiology, causal inference, and big data.",There is a need for better prevention and preparation strategies to improve the wellbeing of the population as well as protect the health and safety of those most at risk. My hope is to devise optimal plans for decision makers to make better-informed decisions backed by scientific evidence to mitigate losses at the economic level and to look after the health of the public through the transmission of reliable instructions and guidance.,,[About Me](https://chenyangsu.github.io/)&nbsp;[Linkedin](https://ca.linkedin.com/in/chen-yang-su)&nbsp;[Twitter](https://twitter.com/chenyangsu)
Makesh Narsimhan,"I am currently pursuing M.Sc. in Computer Science at the Université de Montréal / Mila under the supervision of Prof. Aaron Courville. My research interests include Natural Language generation, dialog agents, language modeling and the intersection of NLP and reinforcement learning.I have always been fascinated by time series analysis, and this challenge provides me an opportunity to work on a very interesting and relevant problem in this domain. Being involved in this project which has the potential to have a strong impact on people’s lives has been a very rewarding experience.",,,[GitHub](https://github.com/makeshn)&nbsp;[Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/makesh-narsimhan-sreedhar-b21b9712a/)
