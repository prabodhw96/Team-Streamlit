## Streamlit
Streamlit lets you turn python scripts into sharable web apps . It's all Python, open-source, and free!

Streamlit’s architecture allows you to write apps the same way you write plain Python scripts. To unlock this, Streamlit apps have a unique data flow: any time something must be updated on the screen, Streamlit reruns your entire Python script from top to bottom.

This can happen in two situations:
* Whenever you modify your app’s source code.
* Whenever a user interacts with widgets in the app. For example, when dragging a slider, entering text in an input box, or clicking a button.
